# 🧓 Age Prediction from Facial Images using Deep Learning

This project builds a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict a person's age based on facial images. It utilizes the UTKFace dataset, which contains thousands of face images labeled by age, gender, and ethnicity.

## 🗂️ Dataset
- [UTKFace Dataset](https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/)
- Contains over 20,000 face images with age labels
- Age ranges from 0 to 116

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib for visualization

## 📦 Requirements

```bash
pip install numpy pandas opencv-python tensorflow keras matplotlib scikit-learn
